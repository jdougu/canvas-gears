# Canvas Gears

## GLXGears rendered in software using canvas paths.

[Live demo](https://jdudy.github.io/canvas-gears/)

Rotate by dragging mouse or arrow keys, w toggles wireframe.

The paths are drawn back to front (painters algorithm) based on their centroids,
this results in a few glitches, especially when viewing the gears edge on.
